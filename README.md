# DS5010Project

Topics to study:

(Soundfile): 
	Import x audio format, make numpy array, export as any audio format

Main:
	Analysis:
	Spectrogram (Mel Scale, DB Scale not amplitude)
	Tempo
		transient detection
	Key/Note
		fundemental frequency/pitch detection
		Detect all pitches in sample

	Analytics to research:
		Spectral Centroid
		Spectral Rolloff
		Spectral Bandwidth
		Zero-Crossing Rate
		Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCCs)
		Chroma feature
		Fourier transform

	Manipulation:
	Reverse
		slices of array in place
	Time Stetch

Changes:
split, midside, invert, reverse, vectorscope, improved testing, multicursor
